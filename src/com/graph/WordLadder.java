/**
 * A transformation sequence from word beginWord to word endWord using a dictionary wordList is a sequence of words beginWord -> s1 -> s2 -> ... -> sk such that:
 *
 * Every adjacent pair of words differs by a single letter.
 * Every si for 1 <= i <= k is in wordList. Note that beginWord does not need to be in wordList.
 * sk == endWord
 * Given two words, beginWord and endWord, and a dictionary wordList, return the number of words in the shortest transformation sequence from beginWord to endWord, or 0 if no such sequence exists.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation: One shortest transformation sequence is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> cog", which is 5 words long.
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore there is no valid transformation sequence.
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 1 <= beginWord.length <= 10
 * endWord.length == beginWord.length
 * 1 <= wordList.length <= 5000
 * wordList[i].length == beginWord.length
 * beginWord, endWord, and wordList[i] consist of lowercase English letters.
 * beginWord != endWord
 * All the words in wordList are unique.

     * Approach 1: Breadth First Search
     * Intuition
     *
     * Start from beginWord and search the endWord using BFS.
     *
     * Algorithm
     *
     * Do the pre-processing on the given wordList and find all the possible generic/intermediate states. Save these intermediate states in a dictionary with key as the intermediate word and value as the list of words which have the same intermediate word.
     *
     * Push a tuple containing the beginWord and 1 in a queue. The 1 represents the level number of a node. We have to return the level of the endNode as that would represent the shortest sequence/distance from the beginWord.
     *
     * To prevent cycles, use a visited dictionary.
     *
     * While the queue has elements, get the front element of the queue. Let's call this word as current_word.
     *
     * Find all the generic transformations of the current_word and find out if any of these transformations is also a transformation of other words in the word list. This is achieved by checking the all_combo_dict.
     *
     * The list of words we get from all_combo_dict are all the words which have a common intermediate state with the current_word. These new set of words will be the adjacent nodes/words to current_word and hence added to the queue.
     *
     * Hence, for each word in this list of intermediate words, append (word, level + 1) into the queue where level is the level for the current_word.
     *
     * Eventually if you reach the desired word, its level would represent the shortest transformation sequence length.
     *
     * Termination condition for standard BFS is finding the end word.
