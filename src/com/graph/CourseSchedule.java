/**
 * There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses - 1. You are given an array prerequisites where prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that you must take course bi first if you want to take course ai.
 *
 * For example, the pair [0, 1], indicates that to take course 0 you have to first take course 1.
 * Return the ordering of courses you should take to finish all courses. If there are many valid answers, return any of them. If it is impossible to finish all courses, return an empty array.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
 * Output: [0,1]
 * Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So the correct course order is [0,1].
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: numCourses = 4, prerequisites = [[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2]]
 * Output: [0,2,1,3]
 * Explanation: There are a total of 4 courses to take. To take course 3 you should have finished both courses 1 and 2. Both courses 1 and 2 should be taken after you finished course 0.
 * So one correct course order is [0,1,2,3]. Another correct ordering is [0,2,1,3].
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: numCourses = 1, prerequisites = []
 * Output: [0]

     * Suppose we are at a node in our graph during the depth first traversal. Let's call this node A.
     *
     * The way DFS would work is that we would consider all possible paths stemming from A before finishing up the recursion for A and moving onto other nodes. All the nodes in the paths stemming from the node A would have A as an ancestor. The way this fits in our problem is, all the courses in the paths stemming from the course A would have A as a prerequisite.
     *
     * Now we know how to get all the courses that have a particular course as a prerequisite. If a valid ordering of courses is possible, the course A would come before all the other set of courses that have it as a prerequisite. This idea for solving the problem can be explored using depth first search. Let's look at the pseudo-code before looking at the formal algorithm.
     *
     * ➔ let S be a stack of courses
     * ➔ function dfs(node)
     * ➔     for each neighbor in adjacency list of node
     * ➔          dfs(neighbor)
     * ➔     add node to S
     * Let's now look at the formal algorithm based on this idea.
     *
     * Algorithm
     *
     * Initialize a stack S that will contain the topologically sorted order of the courses in our graph.
     * Construct the adjacency list using the edge pairs given in the input. An important thing to note about the input for the problem is that a pair such as [a, b] represents that the course b needs to be taken in order to do the course a. This implies an edge of the form b ➔ a. Please take note of this when implementing the algorithm.
     * For each of the nodes in our graph, we will run a depth first search in case that node was not already visited in some other node's DFS traversal.
     * Suppose we are executing the depth first search for a node N. We will recursively traverse all of the neighbors of node N which have not been processed before.
     * Once the processing of all the neighbors is done, we will add the node N to the stack. We are making use of a stack to simulate the ordering we need. When we add the node N to the stack, all the nodes that require the node N as a prerequisites (among others) will already be in the stack.
     * Once all the nodes have been processed, we will simply return the nodes as they are present in the stack from top to bottom.
     * Let's look at an animated dry run of the algorithm on a sample graph before moving onto the formal implementations.
