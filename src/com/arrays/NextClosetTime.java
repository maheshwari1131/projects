/**
 * Given a time represented in the format "HH:MM", form the next closest time by reusing the current digits. There is no limit on how many times a digit can be reused.
 *
 * You may assume the given input string is always valid. For example, "01:34", "12:09" are all valid. "1:34", "12:9" are all invalid.

/**
 * Input: time = "19:34"
 * Output: "19:39"
 * Explanation: The next closest time choosing from digits 1, 9, 3, 4, is 19:39, which occurs 5 minutes later.
 * It is not 19:33, because this occurs 23 hours and 59 minutes later.
